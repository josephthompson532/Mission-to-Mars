# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
In this project scraped information and images from the nasa.gov website and displayed them in a Flask app that I created. To do this I incorporated a Mongo database, BeautifulSoup, Splinter as well as an index.html file to style and display my scraped data.

## Results
The website is capable of all features I set out to apply to it. It successfully scraped images, news, and even table information from nasa.gov and displays it in an easy to read format at the click of a single button.
